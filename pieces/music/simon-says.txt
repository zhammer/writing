i said,
stop walking away [this is]
violence(?)
the way you move your hands up on the
silence(?)
makes me think of silence
so

you were oh(?)
runnin' by the river bed
i put my hand[s] down
couldn't half believe what you had said

violet lights above our
head
it's a stupid song but i've been wonderin' why
you ain't choose no other guy instead
silly old me
i never believed
in myself
i've dedicated [age|chased] 27 to my health
won't be long headed(?) back to where i once went

you were risin' like the sunshine
i thought i was dyin'
i was waitin' there
(i thought i was cryin' i was waitin' on the rails)(???)
saw somethin' in your mind
i luh(?)
you say love you i say simon says

(we could go away, i could cook brussels from the field)(?)
(nothin strange out anymore)(?)
i got something that...
feel

(nothin wild anymore i got)(?)
(you still)(?)

???
left to walk and wonder why
???

we used to fight upon the hill
with my dad til mom would break & cry
that's when i would break and cry
i said
whatever it is i did
whatever it is i, did
dip my feet back in the river bed

there's lights inside your pool
shimmer something more
much more special than the sky
those nights was after school
weekend friday what a ride
long vacation when the summer ends
long we'd talk when we would drive
where it all begin

you were i(?)
??? past the bed you were lookin' right into my eyes
(those kinds we were scared)(?)
i ain't tryna stop myself or misconfuse my names
runnin(?) til my cheeks turn red
we would run across the (i)?

??? simon says
red light, green light
(now i'm feelin dead)(?)
