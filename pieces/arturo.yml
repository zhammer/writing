          the pebbles, with the little waves of the lake splashing up into my hair.
          I used to, it sounds stupid, I used to imagine that there, the, that the
          splashes, when I’d close my eyes I imagined the splashes were footsteps of
          watery kings.

          way, to jump so high, and he would have jumped back, and sailed back down

          Arturo and the customer now have their backs touching each other. And you
          can see in Arturo’s eyes that he is all full of love. And all that pain is
          gone. And if he turns around she will disappear. So he looks at the
          walrus. And the walrus, doesn’t even know that arturo is there. The walrus
          frisks his whiskers, and shoves some sand with his flippers, right up
          towards the moon.

          Mother and Mother Dos drive home from the beach on the highway. It’s
          night. You can see a few stars, and from out the window the baby arturo
          watches the street lights fly by.

          Baby arturo lays in the back seat, and listens to the sounds of the road.
          His bare feet are touching the window; it’s cold. When he takes his foot
          away there’s a mark, and a little line of condensation around where his
          foot had been. He reaches out and puts his hand on the divider, and feels
          around, and Mother Dos puts her hand on his.

          I learned a great recipe the other day. Roast sea bass. A little tomato.
          Some lemon. Olive oil, garlic, cayenne. I know some people like to eat the
          eyes; I don’t like to eat the eyes. I, I’m always worried about the bones.
          But we should go fishing again. Get a snapper popper. Remember that?
          Styrofoam cone, orange rim, you just pop it in the water and the snappers
          bite. Are they in season in August? I forget.

          What is Arturo thinking of? His eyes are closed. Occasionally he lifts his
          eyelids and looks at his moms. He’s in a space ship, it seems, and Mother
          Dos holding his hand from the passenger seat makes him feel like it’s all
          okay.

          I wish there was a place to pull over. It’s always so funny when Arty has
          to pee, and we pull over on the highway. It’s — funny. I want to lay out
          on the grass and watch the stars. Why don’t we do it every night? I c— I
          don’t think it would get old. There are just too many up there. Do you —
          ha. I, nevermind. Where would you want to go fishing?

          The highway bumps, buh-bump, buh-bump. It’s smooth and it has a rhythm.
          Arturo in the back seat, falling asleep, into those dreams, his hand held
          by Mother Dos, her skin, just the touch, makes him feel safe. Like being
          in the ocean. As he drifts into sleep, we see images of the beach. Of the
          waves. They are coming to Arty. Tonight he will dream of the sea. His hair
          is all puffed up. The window is cold. Mother and Mother Dos talk, to
          Arturo they sound as calm as cellos. Like the soft playing of a piano. He
          begins to think of a fish, swimming through the sea, and it comes right to
          Arty’s face and rubs its fins against his nose.

          The fish in Arty’s dream swims off, forward, into the sea, and Arty swims

          Arturo and Cord sit in a dorm room. Arturo’s back is against the bed
          frame, Cord’s against a wood chair. A rap beat plays, they have some bud
          lights on the floor, a few are half full and warm, one or two are empty or

          Neither knows what to say. The beat follows. Cord is working something out
          in his head. Arturo takes another sip of beer. There’s a bong in the

          Arturo laughs again. They go on, sharing verses, talking about music,
          drinking beer. The camera zooms out, through the window. Next door there
          is a small group of shy students watching tv and playing a board game. As
          the camera zooms out, we see the whole building, it’s now night, and it is
          strange to see all of the showers ripped out from the building, laying
          sideways on the grass. Hands come out of the ground, emerging like the
          hands of zombies, and begin to wildly turn the nobs, but no water comes
          out, and more and more hands emerge from the grass, and one of the showers
          breaks, and if we were to watch forever the grass would be covered by
          shattered white porcelain and arm-shaped holes.
