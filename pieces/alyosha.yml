          than none ever was?

          I cycle home in the rain, sometimes. And the wind is in my face. And there’s a little drizzle all on me, you know? There’s a little drizzle on my brow and I’m smiling and the rain follows the shape of my face, my smile, and goes to my ears, and maybe a little drop goes in my right ear. I look out at the water. Sometimes I imagine that there is, you know, made of water… another me, another me made of water, cycling beside me above the east riv… the williamsburg bridge, Lise.

How quickly do the tides move, Lise? I… run to the battery and back. The grotesque battery is melting, lise. The eiffel tower and the freedom tower look at each other in disgust with their eyes.

          The wind has stopped. The entire east river is dry. There is a shattered mandolin on the rocks. There is a squid flailing on the rocks. There is a crown of flowers betwixt its tentacles. To ALYOSHA it looks as beautiful as Lise’s decrepet hair.

          ALYOSHA turns around and looks at the teacher. The bottom of the teachers eyes, only when viewed through the eyes of the teacher, are turning pink. Alyosha puts his pen to his journal but it only digs a hole through the pages. A man runs wildly down the river bank. A quarter mile up the riverbank we see that his wife has pulled a grouper from the water. It is slimy and slapping itself madly against the cement. The man trips. The fish slowly succumbs to death.

Sometimes I am in an open field and I see a caterpillar hanging down from the heavens, the sun on it, waiting for a metamorphosis that will never come, for someone will surely walk into it, Lise!

Kolya is lost in his talking thoughts, ALYOSHA is listening but also fixated at something else. Occasionally he smiles. The water is all speckled with glaring white sunlight. ALYOSHA thinks of MADAME KOLOKHOV. ALYOSHA thinks of a moment on his bike ride in which he saw a wild falling leaf fall before him before he knew it to be a bird. ALYOSHA stares at a pidgeon walking along the cement.

I must know what you think! Of course I have my own thoughts. But is he who walks from the church unholy?

          And here I am! Agh. Karamazov. I say that he who walks from the church in his youth is holy. Do you want to know why I say this? I think of... I think of this vision of the whole, is it not for the child to say that all of this is wrong? And to rebel then against the thing in which he sees his parents pray? In which has come to represent, does the child know that the church is his more than his fathers? That the church is his more than his parishioner? That the rabbi should bow before the boy! When children enter the church it is the rabbi, Karamazov, I am all mixed up. But it is the child who should know, and they do! They do! What child does not go into their temple and see the candle burning and say "this is a light which God has lit for me?" And then the child grows up. And sees the pain of the tendons of inter-personal pain. Of that hidden pain. I call you young Karamazov because you look into my eyes, at moments, with the same disarming love of a child on the street, who sees you, you are just walking down the street, with the "doctor's shawl" (I do think that is very profound, very profound!) covering you, every part of you, the shawl has covered and engulfed every part of you, until suddenly you look down, and a child h, a child who is gripping the hand of a mother, or is perhaps still even , on their bike, with three wheels! Or perhaps in a stroller. Accidentally you look down and then tendons of your mind brings your eyes right to them. Why is that Karamazov? It's like as if I were spun around with a blindfold on and told to throw a dart, and then the moment that the blindfold is taken off I throw the dart and it hits the bullseye every time, but I don't even know there is a dart board there! I don't even know! Then suddenly I move my head and my gaze and I am looking right into the eyes of a child. It is so strange. Is that not also what happens when we, walking down the street, look up, from whatever has been distracting us a moment ago and then look directly at someone? And we say "do not worry, dear friend, I will not look at you again!" and affix all of the muscles of our body to look away. Then we turn a corner. And we hear a sound. And we turn around. And he and I are looking right at each other in the eyes again. And we say "I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I did not mean to remind you that we are all here and together under the light of God! So brother, go on! Turn that corner so that we can never see each other again! This is the decency, the little gift that I give to you, to erase you from my mind and my eyes! This is the gift I give to you!"
