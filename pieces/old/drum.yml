description: "a collection of poems/sketches i wrote in my junior year of college. i don't love them. the writing is heavily inspired by kerouac's 'visions of cody' (which i was reading at the time) and inherits a lot of his egotism & crudeness."

          where the old men in stores...

          where the beach nearby...

          phosphorescent night...

          selling old trinkets for gold...

        content: HIGH SCHOOL was a time of such adventure - though i spent long boring & grey gloomy weekends falling in my chair - so tired that my feet slipped from under my desk & in call-and-response newton physics my chair'd push back a little bit - or roll on four black wheels with center spools like charcoal bun & silver burger sandwiches - and my chair'd roll back on the wooden floor crackling sounds of dust pushed & crackled from the heavy pressure of my back and ass now pushed hard against this chair - as my calfs{{ footnote "i'm almost certain i meant to write 'thighs' here" }} had now slipped off the cushioned black pseudo-leather like a cottony-car interior with black covering leather seat - that usually rose up or grew at the front where my thighs sat to let my tailbone rest perfect spine like those skeletons of back spines perched on cold surgery instructional metal in doctor's offices and hospital rooms - with little pink & green or cartilage semi-opaque - almost like tender or preserved meat - with lines in patterns on top of the cold old meat rubber - like the bottom of the wavy sea or a drainage vent on the street with little rivers of water running along each cold black metal beam and dripping all along the edges perhaps like clothes hangers sporadically patterned or placed in a messy college or dorm closet cold rod clothing bar - though those positions and points where water gathers into little beads and pulls off like a perfect inward penumbra cone topped or top-of-christmas-tree droplet and falls - and all the kids say "ahh" - ker-plunk - and the water echoes from the bottom of the sewer like rats scurrying by with wet feet - though while these beadlets fall like dew falling off of evergreens themselves the beadlets slide down with gravity gently towards the side of the vent against the curb or sidewalk - to push right against the base of the sidewalk against the river tar - which comes up in the middle like a small hill or pitcher's mound - so the kids watch rain drivers from their windows at home next to the parallel trickling and occasionally shooting white airy foamy icy droplets of water in the air - or if there's hard rain constant raindrops ricocheting off these tiny wild rainy road streams - while the drivers on this little pitcher's mound asphalt don't have to worry — Billy in the backseat watches drops rush across his window like racers - occasionally pausing and "sticking" to the glass or merging with the million other island raindrops on the window who haven't moved at all and in fact just stuck there in a similar all over but sorta sickly pattern as red splotches (small) & scattered on the back or palm of a slightly dehydrated hand - then rolls down the window - splashing some rain mist on his face like a football water spritzer with a styrofoam yellow fan on it - almost like a pez dispenser - used on hot dry days in camp bunkrooms filled with sweaty brown-skinned white boys all reclined back on their beds with their shoulders against the walls spraying themselves over and over - some seeing if they can be the "faster" sprayer with the bunkmate to their right - and saying "ahh" like candy apples and later that night talking about bead-jizz masturbation or baby powder — Billy closes the window again to now see big water veins running horizontal on the new geography window - a new rain pattern - though familiar - like steam shower windows and rubbing hands in circles on the glass - or - if a real technologist child here - rubbing shampoo creamy soap (mom's) on the glass door to now make one big great giant circle or series of diagonal sideways handstreaks like tiger strikes - or lines of fur - on a rhombus - of no drips or fog at all but just some bubbly white soap in small edges where the hand rubbed concentric circles - so the veins on the window like the glass vescular interior of a human at a "bodies" museum made of pretty parts - with big glass bodies like chinamen preserved in "start-of-track-race" position with the body made of clear glass - the veins and brain of light blue glass like icy pristine mountain snowy water - and the nerves a sparkler yellow - like the sparklers shooting with amazed kid holding & seeing it for the first time at four — shooting through the body and the heart a hologram projected on four holographic panels deep in the glass - so that as you walk around it the direction of the heart suddenly meets your eyes - to always draw attention to the hologram heart - and the electricity and snow glass brain tickle the periphery — and these watery veins on the window - now distracted by other tinted window raindrop zooming cars pushing forward and backward like a shot of horse race of just the heads of horses or the horse race carrot & whip odd out of place WWII carnival games at dave & busters - with cyclone cylinder with lightbulb - no - not now - distracted by the cars in back and big wood electric wire polls with transformers on top being shaken by the wind - or - as if the wood totems were ent or mystic beasts or spirit guards in the rainy woods - like an old battered struck-by-lightening alaskan husky racer - hard and with hard wrinkled face like cement statue "battling" the crazy pelt like gusty rain wind just by facing it head on like a rugged buddha - and the wires black and wet rubbery bouncing up and down and clanking into each other like wild tap dancers so as to start an electric storm or signaling lightening to "strike here" as if it's written big in neon and flickering above - the veins now dribble back and separate - as if the big print and pattern of rainy vessels had been pulled back into the windy night by god - to just reveal that same old japan or caribbean island pattern - with just as much islands as "land" (glass) though the islands are wiry at the edges - god - the doctor's office? - the skeletons? - i'd fall to the entire floor with just my neck and head held by the front cushion of my black four-legged (coming out of one beam like two cross perpendicular candle holders or helicopter blades thick rough bumpy plastic and angled slightly down to meet the wheels) - i fall with my whole ass and legs and thighs (and tailbone too even) weighted and sleeping on the cold wood floor while my head supported precariously and just-to-slip & plunk hard against the floor or wheels under the chair - and my hands are still on my wood desk keyboard - raised high above my head like a witch casting an electric spell on a mountain - while i type on aim or to ******** **** that i could make her love me & later think about her mouth under my desk half-illuminated - masturbating.

          IN CAR with dante and justin driving back from UNC - had gotten high with kush friday and saturday and had 5 fried chicken sandwiches in 24 hours - dante and i pick up two mcChickens on the way back with a janitor retard friendly who smiles at you and makes you want to back away (child porn) though you know he's nice — before that — janitor had a mop and bucket and refilled the ketchup —


          now stuck in dark traffic by massive trucks in rain with red lights all down the side at the bottom where the truck ad ends and is white steel or paint spray though smooth like an insta-border (on instagram) which im taking actually of the night —


          Ambulances in front - a real night spectacle - we're all here together - like cars at a drive-in - admiring the lights - dante or justin in the backseat with my green shirt (i'm now wearing just AA grey hoodie & aware of my manboobs) wrapped around eyes and dreaming - that peaceful backseat sleep in slow traffic - the whole night is humming - we're in one of the most beautiful cosmoses - drivers can drift off and sleep then open their eyes and roll a few feet forward - like dogs sleeping and waking up to scratch their nose -


          earlier justin and i and tayze drove around zaxby's over and over to get salt & forks & straws & more chicken - at UNC mike played guitar in his new room and we drank whiskey & coke in red cups that wreaked only of whiskey - when i'd put my nose to it & hope for coke smell - rakesh must've said "c'mon dog" when he saw it half-full still after the first sip i took with the boys


          to start the night we go walk on some wide neverending street that curves by some woods or fence hiding some coliseum cause music is playing loud like you'd hear at the wimbledon kids days - shark kingston - we party for a bit and run into drunk guys stumbling down the street - which we look down on but are most nights - and small groups of boy-girl friends crossing the street corner


          i grab a cold beer from an icy gatorade bucket water cooler cylinder or garbage can of - all shining aluminum metally cold so that when you grasp it it cools the sweat on your hands and makes little clouds fog outline around your fingers - glistening under the light - pick one up chug it its so cold dante doesnt believe me - we almost fall asleep - hailey hot but "psycho" barbie makes justin drink vodka gatorade & i do too we both run to the bathroom it's sitting on our burgers on the top of the esophostomach and we laugh hysterically - justin with his hand over his stomach rolled over and me walking back and forth by the sinks maniac laughing and dry heaving - we get stoned sit between two stores with path to backyard parking lot on a "curb" raised cement facing left store thats black glass so reflection present but dante kush and j maybe looking at the ground - we all took bong rips - j too - who says he's not high but walking through parking lot says "i wanna record everything" and does - thinks he's dreaming - it's hysterical j's so funny dante loves him already and just met him - all our phones die - mike - who promised he wouldnt "bang some bitch" after frat rush bangs some bitch and doesnt answer calls - next day felt bad but its hilarious we coulda died really - he got ass - we were fine - we walk around for hours - massive streets always ending up at the same corner concrete fence or wall maybe 5am morning no one out but us - finally walk by big tenement apartments which look familiar - they remind me of big brown just-entered-new york apartment brick towering brooklyn - the first ones you see where grandmas live - though *actually* theyre familiar cause theyre near our car - which i dont believe til suddenly i realize we're in a parking lot where we'd parked it cause i recognize a big green SUV that unloaded a couch or mini fridge when we arrived - glory hallelujah kush is about dead and so are we justin and i take backseats i'm left kush front dante passenger - we put back our chairs - me and j - thinking we're so genius for backseat shotgun though the back car - with seats pushed down forward - to make one big "trunk" has awful fabric like itchy grey velcro carpet and hard metal bars - we're all moaning and agonizing every time we get "boned" and kush yells out - as we all fall asleep - letting out viral giggles like when you and a friend delirious try to keep it together in class so teacher doesnt send you outside for a giggle fit - but falling back asleep between the after giggles each time more delirious than before - kush yells out "we got boned sonnies!" and laugh all of us so hard to crying heaving out our stomachs the real painful sacred high laughs when dante and i or dante i and kush look at each other shaking our hands at each other begging it to stop cause its so damn funny til we all keel over and take a deep breath - like when dante woke up screaming high once and fell right to sleep - though now breathing deep and adrenaline we come to and sit up i ask kush for water he takes out a bottle pours it right out the window - after slowly opening the window and staring like a maniac - me begging "no no" through crazy sacred laughs - we all go insane laughing though i wonder if i'm in a dream (or just the best joke or even wonder if he really poured out the water to be funny) but he stares like a nut with a bengali beared gone insane by the timeout chicken and super smash bros and wandering - and at one point that night he got so sad over ***** he just went and sat on some log - and the funniest rakesh is drunk sad with his head down but always next to some eccentric wide-eyed fratboy like ***** ******* saying "kush this pussy is wild!" to which kush shrugs whimpers "yeah man" high pitched like a 7th grader & frat boy ****** ****** just continues "and the weed was wild" - "yeah man i feel you"


          kush then shoots his finger in the air like goofy (from loony tunes) and pulls out a second water bottle - "you think i would leave you hangin' yukesbones?!" - and justin finds this hilarious - i think it's funny too but wish i didnt have to share this water bottle - like we couldve had two bottles stranded in this car and the dorm we're parked at's locked - though i admire the joke - like te'zer's "shit on my floor" - kush shat on my floor and had an extra carpet rolled up outside ready to put right down.


          sleep takes hold - we're too tired to talk though all you gotta do is moan to make dante giggle and whenever one of us makes any sound a wave giggle like a quiet wavy starry lake rolls up to shore & calms us to a sleep


          i - now - and time at this points broken - so it feels like yesterday or six years from now - and i suddenly get up like im sleepwalking - everyones asleep totally though when i open the door dante rolls over and murmers - i just get back up in the twilight parking lot to go piss or shit in the locked dorm - a black woman with hair back in a pony tale and shiny green security jacket sees me come out of this car thats been parked in the lot for two hours - 7 am - mind you this is move-in day and is the first official day of school - i walk by she pays no mind - which i thinks hilarious - and open the dorm door just as id open the school doors on a regular day in 7th grade and walk right to the bathroom like i know where it is and shit. i burst out laughing on the toilet - once i break through this sleep zombie path-like event-chain and realize i somehow got in this building - wipe go to the front door open & close it four times like im playing with a squeaky gingerbread door to see if it works - go back inside and find a lit up room of green couches like the promised land and run back to kush's black subaru - open the doors - they all wake up look at me like babies wipe their eyes and say "watchu doin?" though i was pretty eccentric stoned staying up til 8am or 9 even - past dawn looking at andrews commons and pembroke - so i guess theyre not all surprised though we're no longer maniacs just sleepy jingly morning kids - which is just obvious - like falling asleep hallucinating everyone talking loud in their respective corners of their mind one night and waking up in the morning - throwing on a sweater and getting waffles - i tell them everything and they say "whaaat" —


          my biblical salvation shit - the water pour - the zaxby's drive around - alex's smash bros (which i barely mentioned) - and "i'm boned" would all become big throwback jokes that'd bring us back - or me at least - to one of the most magical weekends of my life. the door opens & in disbelief - i show them the toilet i dookied in - and we all call couches and arm chairs you can see the dust floating like ghostly fireflies from the sunbeams in the window - we all laugh hysterically sleep it off - wake up (with families walking through our crazy living room with their first semester freshman) and roll back to the car - hysterical and tired but alert


          dante says "oh my god" like he used to when we were crazier people - i sat peacefully in the backseat really loving my friends - i never thought i'd have friends like this - we go grab chicken sandwiches giggle in the drivethru some of us stoned over and i spill a big wad of cheese or tomato sauce on my green shirt or carseat


          (four guys - us four still drunk idiots crawling out of a car at twilight and stumbling into a dorm that wasnt ours by a security guard who somehow doesnt even look our way - though she's facing us - is probably the fucking funniest image i can imagine)

          SARAH WITH A SMALL VCR records herself writing & stops rolls now on the wood floor - she is four again & dog knows too licking her legs laughing & parents come home - to room - alone & reminiscing on everything and her nostalgic diamond headcenter sends tears to her eyes & remembers Mom and Dad - & what would they think now - she's old - death-bound - 20 & paranoyd and so lonely she thinks it'll never end - old shirts she never wears in the closet - mom dad stepping up the stairs talking violins & she lays in bed & tickles her ear - and wants to go home - old familiar trees in window covering the pool from the quiet night - bathing moonlit arms — o what sadness life has brung - to Sarah - who only wants a well-wet soul - soaked with love & Friends - & nights - & bright days - to sell old books on caterpillars to children - write stories about moonfeet and wonder wars — My door is rattling to tell me it's ok - & keeps rattling even past this poem - All Zach i love you please know forever and grab your fingers into my hair i'm crying

          CARL has seen the peak of everest from afar and though lila charles and carl's stepdad saw it only as a snow triangle, the peak - as carl now believes & can only procure to tell - has called for him - in a great snowy vision of god from atop that peak - and last night i dreamed of an extra verse of rain -


          and now instead of strength to climb it - as again carl is selected - not dead - holy tho perhaps just lucky & giving godly pretenses to coincidence - in that the same way one can visualize a banana and its smoothie tastes from outside the green skin two weeks away carl felt himself - free and like a martyr on top of the mountain on top of the world & so's received old everest call in the buddhist form of pure experience - tho everet (everest before its own transformation to earthly understanding once sent out elevation pamphlets & packets of snow (by this point melted) to the eastern sea cities & no one answered the call as the paper were wet & the numbers were too big and impossibly abacussed -


          and carl is weak at mind and again has gotten earth & nature intertwined with god - like a carpenter with lazy tools - & will (as he thinks in some other snowy way) let the Tables carve themselves now goes crazy in his crazy pursuit (Stepdad & starla back at lodge or san francisco)[Carl saw everest on a post card! in hawaii] & now sends long-massed and crazy eyed letters to family & professors calling for a new world! a pully to everest! for all men even the coconut visionaries & those who "only want goat milk"-


          "i have seen it" he says & frets off nervous & "what of the women with pink tents who just climbed it"


          & most importantly oh Carl oh crazed soul man & all my art friends whom i've seen gone mad ***** for pursuit of buddha hill - why not just climb - and will you think of sending letters then when atop the hill - sitting - & the whole world drooped beneath your snowy eyes & your hair brushed & drinking highest air?


          (and will you care about anything in the perfect beauty of mount everest?)

          ...i even say before this - "hey we could also walk at night" but we cant & she wants to see me & i want to see her - to my right - with the sea behind her - tranquil - holding each other's hands by just the fingertips almost ready to pull & break grasps - tho to stay like that - like dancing with your lips so close but not kissing - and know both of us how fragile & free our love is - & i would watch her sad eyes look out forward on the beach watching the waves roll in rolls & hearing their faraway crashes & seeing the silentest ones way in the distance like faraway baseballs & birds and say "i just want to go away forever" exactly as she would gentle poetry voice internal & without the beauty of her mouth had i not been there...
