DRUM (CASKET) is a collection of poems/sketches i wrote in my junior year of college. i remember that i was reading kerouac's "visions of cody" at the time. specifically the section where he does (i think) hand-written sketches of some memories of his time "on the road." i was pretty amazed by the power of his writing and would occasionally put down the book (when some "writing"-style thought would start moving in my head) and take out one of my moleskine notebooks and write. so the writing style very much follows that of the visions of cody sketches.

i feel uneasy reading these now (august 2021). there's a lot of boastfulness & crudeness that i took (learned?) from the beat writers. i think i initially called the collection "DRUM" because i was taking a class on ghanaian drumming. i also probably had in mind some of bob dylan's "drum" imagery (mr. tambourine man, "my arabian drums", "my songs're written with the kettledrum in mind"). i later had the idea to call the collection "DRUM (CASKET)". why? i'm not totally sure. it just came to me while i was playing piano at my old family house, i think. but later on i thought that "casket" was me laying (or trying to lay) this part of my life to rest. the egoistic beat-inspired writer. there's a lot about death in avril 14th which is, i think, the first "big thing" i wrote after putting together these poems.

so that's that. i think looking back now that these poems are a casket. it took me a while but i'm happy that i realized that the beats are not the type of people i want to be.
