HIGH SCHOOL was a time of such adventure - though i spent long boring & grey gloomy weekends falling in my chair - so tired that my feet slipped from under my desk & in call-and-response newton physics my chair'd push back a little bit - or roll on four black wheels with center spools like charcoal bun & silver burger sandwiches - and my chair'd roll back on the wooden floor crackling sounds of dust pushed & crackled from the heavy pressure of my back and ass now pushed hard against this chair - as my calfs had now slipped off the cushioned black pseudo-leather like a cottony-car interior with black covering leather seat - that usually rose up or grew at the front where my thighs sat to let my tailbone rest perfect spine like those skeletons of back spines perched on cold surgery instructional metal in doctor's offices and hospital rooms - with little pink & green or cartilage semi-opaque - almost like tender or preserved meat - with lines in patterns on top of the cold old meat rubber - like the bottom of the wavy sea or a drainage vent on the street with little rivers of water running along each cold black metal beam and dripping all along the edges perhaps like clothes hangers sporadically patterned or placed in a messy college or dorm closet cold rod clothing bar - though those positions and points where water gathers into little beads and pulls off like a perfect inward penumbra cone topped or top-of-christmas-tree droplet and falls - and all the kids say "ahh" - ker-plunk - and the water echoes from the bottom of the sewer like rats scurrying by with wet feet - though while these beadlets fall like dew falling off of evergreens themselves the beadlets slide down with gravity gently towards the side of the vent against the curb or sidewalk - to push right against the base of the sidewalk against the river tar - which comes up in the middle like a small hill or pitcher's mound - so the kids watch rain drivers from their windows at home next to the parallel trickling and occasionally shooting white airy foamy icy droplets of water in the air - or if there's hard rain constant raindrops ricocheting off these tiny wild rainy road streams - while the drivers on this little pitcher's mound asphalt don't have to worry — Billy in the backseat watches drops rush across his window like racers - occasionally pausing and "sticking" to the glass or merging with the million other island raindrops on the window who haven't moved at all and in fact just stuck there in a similar all over but sorta sickly pattern as red splotches (small) & scattered on the back or palm of a slightly dehydrated hand - then rolls down the window - splashing some rain mist on his face like a football water spritzer with a styrofoam yellow fan on it - almost like a pez dispenser - used on hot dry days in camp bunkrooms filled with sweaty brown-skinned white boys all reclined back on their beds with their shoulders against the walls spraying themselves over and over - some seeing if they can be the "faster" sprayer with the bunkmate to their right - and saying "ahh" like candy apples and later that night talking about bead-jizz masturbation or baby powder — Billy closes the window again to now see big water veins running horizontal on the new geography window - a new rain pattern - though familiar - like steam shower windows and rubbing hands in circles on the glass - or - if a real technologist child here - rubbing shampoo creamy soap (mom's) on the glass door to now make one big great giant circle or series of diagonal sideways handstreaks like tiger strikes - or lines of fur - on a rhombus - of no drips or fog at all but just some bubbly white soap in small edges where the hand rubbed concentric circles - so the veins on the window like the glass vescular interior of a human at a "bodies"  museum made of pretty parts - with big glass bodies like chinamen preserved in "start-of-track-race" position with the body made of clear glass - the veins and brain of light blue glass like icy pristine mountain snowy water - and the nerves a sparkler yellow - like the sparklers shooting with amazed kid holding & seeing it for the first time at four — shooting through the body and the heart a hologram projected on four holographic panels deep in the glass - so that as you walk around it the direction of the heart suddenly meets your eyes - to always draw attention to the hologram heart - and the electricity and snow glass brain tickle the periphery — and these watery veins on the window - now distracted by other tinted window raindrop zooming cars pushing forward and backward like a shot of horse race of just the heads of horses or the horse race carrot & whip odd out of place WWII carnival games at dave & busters - with cyclone cylinder with lightbulb - no - not now - distracted by the cars in back and big wood electric wire polls with transformers on top being shaken by the wind - or - as if the wood totems were ent or mystic beasts or spirit guards in the rainy woods - like an old battered struck-by-lightening alaskan husky racer - hard and with hard wrinkled face like cement statue "battling" the crazy pelt like gusty rain wind just by facing it head on like a rugged buddha - and the wires black and wet rubbery bouncing up and down and clanking into each other like wild tap dancers so as to start an electric storm or signaling lightening to "strike here" as if it's written big in neon and flickering above - the veins now dribble back and separate - as if the big print and pattern of rainy vessels had been pulled back into the windy night by god - to just reveal that same old japan or caribbean island pattern - with just as much islands as "land" (glass) though the islands are wiry at the edges - god - the doctor's office? - the skeletons? - i'd fall to the entire floor with just my neck and head held by the front cushion of my black four-legged (coming out of one beam like two cross perpendicular candle holders or helicopter blades thick rough bumpy plastic and angled slightly down to meet the wheels) - i fall with my whole ass and legs and thighs (and tailbone too even) weighted and sleeping on the cold wood floor while my head supported precariously and just-to-slip & plunk hard against the floor or wheels under the chair - and my hands are still on my wood desk keyboard - raised high above my head like a witch casting an electric spell on a mountain - while i type on aim or to ******** **** that i could make her love me & later think about her mouth under my desk half-illuminated - masturbating.
