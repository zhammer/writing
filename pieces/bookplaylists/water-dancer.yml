note: >
  Water Dancer is one of the best books I've read. Ta-Nehisi Coates' language is
  beautiful and poetic (and perfect for me). I read the first half of this book
  slowly over a few months, mainly reading it during flights for work. Debussy's
  piano has always reminded me of water, which is why I chose to read Water
  Dancer over a few Debussy pieces on loop. The surrealist style also helped me
  dive into Coates' lyrical writing style.
