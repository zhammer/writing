note: First time reading a book in the original Spanish. It took forever. But it
  was fun. And, of course, incredible. I remember finding a Murakami interview
  where he talks about Marquez and says something like, "people say what Marquez
  does is magical realism.. but I imagine it is very real to him." I think of
  the flowers falling in the town until the animals couldn't walk. Remedios la
  Bella flying up to heavens, a man with his broken bones and yellow amber
  pouring out of them. Wow. I'd like to read this book again, soon. Though
  there's more spanish I'd like to read, like Casa de Espiritus. Anyways this
  Teresa Gómez record is one of the best. M... what's his name... la Gitona con
  los does igotes?
