  I had been suggested Woolf before and after Brothers Karamazov wanted to take
  some time away from russian lit. I remembered googling "virginia woolf &
  music"... there was a surprising amount written about it, how she "conceived
  of her writing first as music, then as words." Well I found out that "the
  waves" was quite inspired by some beethoven quartets, which I listened to
  while reading the waves.

  I am pretty obsessed with this book!! And also now I like quartets?
