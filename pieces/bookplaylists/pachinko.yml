note: >
  I just started reading Pachinko for my company's new monthly bookclub. I'm
  reading Pachinko over Yiruma's album "Healing Piano". Yiruma is a modern
  Korean composer / pianist; the only reason I copied the album into a playlist
  is that a few of the songs have full band arrangements, which I find a bit
  distracting while reading.
