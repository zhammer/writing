  Big rec from Gabe. It's dawning on me as I backfill these that I need to find
  more of my own books. Dead Souls was part of Gabe's undergrad thesis (I
  believe) and was part of an early vision for a dissertation - comparing some
  symbols in Dead Souls and The Idiot.. particularly the "troika". So I remember
  walking during the bad bad covid times on the east river, under neath the part
  of the FDR between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge where the beams are all
  purple, and Gabe explained to me on the phone about the troika (which for some
  reason I thought was an eagle... maybe that is part of the metaphor?) and
  epilepsy (in The Idiot).

  Without knowing any of the actual content of Dead Souls (besides that last scene) I thought dead souls was going to be something of a horror or ghost story, so I chose a funnily creepy soundtrack to play it to. (Nils Frahm is who I listened to while reading House of Leaves.) I actually thought the eery vibe worked quite well. Particularly ... the parts, that were creepy.
