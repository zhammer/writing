  Have yet to finish this!

  Started reading this collection of Edgar Allen Poe short stories at the suggestion of my friend Gabe, my only other close friend who'd read all of House of Leaves. He was teaching Poe in a university in Russia and told me he felt some of House of Leaves was straight out of Poe. I thought it'd be nice to read it over some Nils Frahm again if that was the case and found the next low-energy album on Frahms' artist page.

  I've only read a few stories from this collection so far - my first Poe since the handful of short stories we read in high school that I probably never actually read. I was blown away by Balloon Hoax. I think I was in tears by the end of reading it, then laughed pretty hard when I looked the story up online and realized why it's called the Balloon Hoax.

  The album has some lulls and then some techno-cinematic climaxes that fit really perfectly with Poe's stories.
