  Not sure why I started reading The Overstory to Mingus Plays Piano. Probably
  just pictured Mingus playing a big wooden piano, and since The Overstory is
  about trees...

  Overstory started out great and (I felt) dwindled a bit in the second half. The vignettes in "Roots" still are some of the most enthralling stories I've read. I come from a family fairly obsessed with trees so the deep-dive into families' connection with trees & nature hit home with me.

  After I finished The Overstory I listened to Sylvan Esso's album "What Now" and had a whole idea of an experimental play about The Overstory (mainly following Nick+Olivia and Ray+Dorothy) set to What Now. "Sound" would play on the intro scene in which the Hoel family's story plays out in rapid speed - young men of the family taking each other's places photographing every morning while a flipbook old photo tree flickers and grows in the background. This would all happen on the left side of the stage while Olivia walks home to her dorm, smokes, and imagines music. Whole thing would end with the sad climax of each story.
