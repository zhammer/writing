  The most engrossing book I've ever read. I first picked it up at my brother's
  apartment in Brooklyn years ago. Years before then (I can't remember when) he
  had told me of a book that is a book inside a book and that the word "house"
  is always in blue and it scared him so much he had to stop reading after 100
  pages. I had generally been a slow reader before then but I'm pretty sure I
  read the entire book in 3-4 days while going back and forth from Providence
  <-> NYC by train or bus. I remember feeling totally nuts when I'd start
  reading the book normally, then flip it over 180 degrees, then hold it
  diagonally, all on public transit.


  I also don't remember *why* I chose to read House of Leaves over "Screws" (I don't even know how I found "Screws" to begin with) but I recommend reading House of Leaves to "Screws" to most people I meet who enjoy reading. Something about the album fits so perfectly. Years later I still imagine that house when  I listen to Screws.
