note: "Rec from Gabe. Though I'd been wanting to read Toni Morrison for a while,
  especially since she passed away, and I read a beautiful tribute piece to her
  in the New Yorker. I had learned about Hazel Scott on the \"memory palace\"
  podcast. Seemed like a nice match. I think of that quote from Kerouac's \"tips
  to spontaneous writing\": \"visionary tics in the chest\". I remember being
  blown away particularly by the end of some chapter, in which -- I forget their
  names -- the lead woman and her prior husband -- make love on the field, and
  \"how sweet and free the juice of the corn\"... or something like that. It was
  september and I happened to be eating a lot of corn, right from the farmers
  market, often raw and sweet from my fridge. Anyway I think something clicked
  for me there about poetry being embedded in a novel, breaking through from the
  novel... subtly, sparingly. I also thought quite a bit about her journey
  through the woods with that strange white girl who was obsessed with red
  velvet (?) during my long trail hike."
