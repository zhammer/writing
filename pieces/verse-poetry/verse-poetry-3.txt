dont move to upset leviathan
dont let its hymns and curls betrothe you
dont wake up crying in the northern light
as if to say
“aye! but dreams of yore shall
once again enclose me
as if golden waters all around
had risen
let off guard
as both lobes slept
unlike a formation of ducks
with one eue open
end to end”

dont fear neptune as he strikes
his sword
gainst the sea
sending waves from shore to shore
which swallow sand
which pick up sand and move it
which swallow sand then bringing back to the
deeper parts

tread slowly out to sea
walk slowly with the tips of toes against the sand
 a shell!
 a shell between the toes!
a field!
a field we walk on.

i am letting myself dream of kissing men.
but those defended would say that a dream is where a man can fully be free.
no!
tis not the case
for in dreams we can mold and move the sword
it is reality like a tempest at the sea
unknown to us
like scratching thumbs as walking room to room
like stubbing of the toe as one turns to walk down
wedding lanes
like a comet descended upon the sky

what was meant to be a gloomy walk down half deserted streets
turned pretty
in the cold winter air
and a full moon which looks as if to say
“should some transatlantic wind come crush us in a blow, we ourselves must be the ones who feel it first
for future generations dane to ask
the feeling of true death
though are we not the same
us and man a million years ago
staring to the future!
staring to the place beyond the waves
the pale,
