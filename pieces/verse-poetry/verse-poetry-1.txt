just awoken in that morning,
like a dream,
to look out the window,
eyes transfixed on the image of a slug
in the garden
as if twere not itself
as if its path and trail of slime
were something shining in the morning light
then frozen
by the wind
which is cold
though also it brings me the memory of dawn
the memory of time

to see it move across the trees
to hear it move across the trees as early wind
before it sloops and drops like a skieer
down the mountaintop

and i see big swaths of hairy trees
leaf-topped
begin to brush
like the brush of wind
like the mother's brush on the babe's hair

but look!
beneath the waves which crest like wind above
the sea

look!
as if flown above by a plane
where the waves stand immovable
in the hard-stretched measure of time

look!
like the mountains seen
long distanced
gazed
beside the fast moving wires
of the city
from the train

yet those mountains do not move,
do they not?
both the babe and the writer transfixed

but doth imagination
like a crutch
which lets the babe touch see and play
with the world
does the playing thus stop
when the babe grows
and learns to touch
and take
and love
and jump
and fall?

tis thee i see beneath these gusts of wind
tis thee like i and you like two birds
flying
and swopping downwards
then up again
does not my imagination hold me like a crutch
does not it also let me dream of better worlds

perhaps! enchanted by the breeze, the light,
that crutch of mine withholding sheds
and becomes something greater, divine

perhaps these words are what i bring
to you and me
but fear of speaking to deaf ears
like the soccer playing shooting,
kicking,
jumping
on an empty stage

but just in joy
like that of the child
to run and jump and flip and all
those things which fill her heart with joy

but look!
to the right,
she looks for her mother
but her mother is gone

or her father is there but forlorn in the day's work!

whom does she look to next?
abovve a bird flies and swoops
does it also seek our eyes
those who dwell on land
to hold it
and even in the cold
which i can only imagine
is frigid in the winter winds
it is warmed by the love of those
bound to earth
closer to the core of the earth
which is warm
which is lava
which erupts through its cores by dane of deed
and circumstance

and i
biking to a friends
in the cold hand grips of winter
which touch my face as if to freeze

am i now writing verse?
am i now flying through the city streets?
is there a warm tunnel which brings me to you

and look here, the baby dreams of tunnels
that bring it.. like the first tunnel from which it arose,
look, light! at the end of it! and death just memory of birth

perhaps to remember is to know, to forget...
like wind forged in the belly of the sky, or the beast,
or the bounty looming above the fate of the poor man's feet

aye, timothy! i saw you there
burnt and broken neath the winds of the city,
which rush through buildings in one fell swoop
like the leaf taken by the highest, creaking tree, that
descends on the mountaintop and look!
it lands,
but before it does,
it does a gesture in the falling wind
as if to say
here!
watch me descend
and watch that tree from which i came from
one high and mighty on the mountain top
now laid on its side
but now showing
what it couldn't show before to man
the vastness of its roots
in wild patterns in the earth
touching other trees
strong and mighty
but
like a glacier beneath the sea
only known by its top appendage
but beneath that veil
i was wise
and large
and with wild pattern
unbeknownst
at times
even to myself
even to the wind
which while graceful
and waking
in the early dawn of mornign
and coming cold from the river to the city
before it hits across its buildings
it shall never know the under ground
or shall it
as it warms as it flows above the magma of the mount
warming
then heading upwards again
then become rain
then falling back to earth?

reader...
i pause for your reply.
