it's a feeling that always eludes me
for a moment,
there
i've thought it like a butterfly before

as a boy to go
to a place with endless butterflies
yellow ones in the trees
ones in a box in my home

nocturnal moths,
which
against the headlamp
burn white
in that night
then move with you
to sunset ridge

at first it was day
then later day
then the sun was golden
and then it was crested by the peaks

above the other mountains the sky is pink
then gold
then blue
but here the sky comes darker

but to see the sun shining on the next peak
the tallest tree drinking that last sip of sun
just the very tip of it is gold

and one could be illuded
to walk through the woods in early fall
to see a crest of leaves yellow
in the sky
and think it sun-
no!
it's just change
it's just the ever changing mountain
the ever changing trees

each leaf born and dead
though the tree still alive
each flower
born and dead
though the earth, the ground, still growing,
nurtured
with no trace left behind
but just that pollen in the wind-

strange strategies,
trees have
to mate and know one another,
to know themselves

*a text message notification dings*

i need a better place to think, to walk-
i do love city streets
i do love
being oh so close to friends-
but, if i were to act upon a dream of young
i would find a small town
one whose buildings
were decrepit
ones whose main street empty now-

perhaps just a market and a coffee shop
for nearby towns

am i an imperialist to want to plant a flag?
am i a coward to try to find happiness there and not here?
in the city with
balls and dance and music and beer?

but to fantasize about a town
a block
a coldisac-
i have a house here
you have a house there

when i was a kid i dreamed of tubes beneath the cities
tubes beneath my house
like those of hamsters
and i'd crawl through them
to you
or i'd crawl through them to
some central place
to me and you

i didn't factor in sleep then
and when i did i began to wish that i could dream with you

but we don't talk about that now
though it, hurt us all to lose it

there's a thing
that glimmers like a memory
though may just be a dream
so how could i stand upon the mount
and say:
this is what i mean
or meant

but to watch the sea change
from the stars, the plane
to look above the clouds on the plane
the listen to piano on the plane
to read
illuminated by that light
and everyone is sleeping now
but you
but i
watching the movie about the boy who found his father
playing guitar
returning to his grandmother
and saying:
see,
this our song
i know it too i just needed a minute
to get there

she shall sing again
and i shall cry

so let us go then, you and i
for hell will not consume us

for perhaps there is more fear to speak
in a land
in which we will
live tomorrow
and see each other again

but i will try to be strong
and though i may not succeed
that is all that i can say
