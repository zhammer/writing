everything was lining up, all the stars, right in front of me, and baby, it felt good, that big blue square before me which promised some sort of salvation from this thing that leaves its tethered roots around your arms, your neck, so you look ot the side and there is someone else in the quick sand, and babye, i knew, driving down tha troad, it was a deep and lonely desert, but i knew somethin then, i remember

the last time i glanced at you, you were by a watermill, the water was pouring in sheaths onto your body and it was stroked with sunlight, a gazzling array, i ran towards you but the mist was in my eyes, and i became like pollen, you know, i was drifitng off into the wind

when we lay down in the quick sand, our bodies piled up like on the railroad tracks, that jack o lantern of a horseless head riding towards us with deaths bitter tears dribbling down his mouth, i'll see you then, i promise you that

take this clock, you can hold it in your hand so perhaps it is more something like an amulet, covered in ants, and in this village in mexico, you dig, there are women wearing green and red and purple dresses, the fabric looks something like the curtains in the dining room of my childhood home, when my dad would fight with me, you know, he'd crowd both lanes, so there was no way that i could get around him, like the bridge in williamsburg,some people take the lower level because it's quicker but i like to be out on top of everythign, you know, i was driving with my brother baby, best believe me, and he said "aren't magicians grand", but he was talking about bridges, and i said, looking at that bridge of cement and cars and people (not crashing andf falling into the sea) spread out across the river, the RFK bridge, you know, the tappanzee, now it has a mad mans name, mad as in angry, didja forget?

i said that a bridge, ya dig, baby listen to me, i saw you with sheaths of water coming down on you, it was magical, it was marvelous and then you dissappeared, your hair was blonde or it was brunette or you were a man or a squid flaoting there in the droplets or even you were a turtle finding your way back home, but slwoly, and i didnt know where the river was, there was a windmill in a sandstorm and afterwards, after don quiixote and his talking jaw rode away, there were only burn marks and stains on the fabric of those towers

fabrizzio was his name, i know that and you know it as well, when water splashes, when hail comes down with fire from the firey mouth of god, which neither you nor i believe in

babe
there is a ttrain coming
you are laying beside me
i see a last glimpse
as if through the mist
and then all i see
is that blinding light

i love you,
sev

p.s. don't get it twisted
you'r the only one who ever meant nothin
to me
