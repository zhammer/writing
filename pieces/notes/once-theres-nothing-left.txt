once there’s nothing left
what will there be?

when the giant sky
that shifted colors
like a chameleon
and hid behind the cloud
and showed it stars at night
like the giant blanket for the dreaming baby

once that’s gone,
what is there?

i imagine a scene of losts people
out on the sea
each in their own beds
one at a time
floating upwards
to something
until they’re gone

and once they’re gone
what waves
will move across the sea
and what will the tides
do
to the people walking on the —

the bottom of the sky is pink like a peach
the top is blue like early day.
