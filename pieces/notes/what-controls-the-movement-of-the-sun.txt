what controls the movement of the sun?
the panorama hanging above the baby’s crib?
the hypotheses’ of ceo?
the dusty book, “goodnight moon”, buried beneath games and garbage on a shelf?

last night two planets collided.
no supernova,
no great change,
no ripple through the cosmos.

a great journalist sat outside
on a cloudy night
and set her intentions
for the coming year.
