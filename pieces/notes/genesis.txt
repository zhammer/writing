I’m liking you, i’m liking you, i’m beginnign to like you, a lot! i like you a lot! i’m liking you.. to like.. like.. you know.. like to be on the beach.. you know.. like to be on the beach..

i’m liking you! planet mars! i’d like to , go there some day. i’d like to go there some day. i’d like to go there some day. a lot! flying to the mars.. there’s a rover there alone, waiting, that rover, waiting, i’m liking you a lot and that.. rover is waiting, and waiting, and it’s on this barren planet, and it’s waiting, to mars! i’d like to be on that beach. splashing water. i’d like to splash you. to see you smile in the water. i want to run my hand under water. i want to run my hand undeer water. to see the wave. to see the wave. i’d like to run my hand under.. to mars!

that rover up there. digging up dirt. nothing found. no footsteps yet. along time ago he’ll be remembered..forgotten, what if the next one that roams mars comes aft.. what is our respons... marching in the streets... i like you... i’m begginning to think of you in the streets... i like you... i’m beginnin.. the beach.. i’d like to se.. splash you, you’re in the water, you’re smiling, i’ve never seen you before, we’re swimming out... we’ve left something by the tree, i’m looking back at the shore, yo’ure swimming further out..

i like you a lot! i like you. i’d like to see you. i’d like to have dinner with you. i’m thinking of a glass of wine. i’m drinking wine and i’m thinking about you. genesis. i’m thinking of the beginning fo time. this is the beginning of a new time! i like you a lot! i like you a lot and i’m thinking of the beginning of a new time


forgotten feelings. you’re making me feel those. i’m remembering camp. i’m remember a conversation. i am who i want to be with you. i am who i want to be with you. to mars! i want to go to mars with you. i want to go to .. the snow is destroyiung the school. we’re trapped in the school. there’s coffee. there’s something warm. there’s a beach. everyones gone and it’s just me and you. everyone’s gone and it’s just me and you.
