***

i dont believe in rain

he looks coyly across the room

i donâ€™t believe in bugs

his eyes flutter, his skin is soft, thin, he has a necklace on that decorates his chest and hangs down towards the blades of grass - a  memory -in circles his fingers circulate the grass, little tornados of wind passing by, my skin is dimpled & kind, wine flows down from the mountain, where we , kids, put our hands into it, cupped, with gold bracelets, we drink it, grtting drunk with each other and laughing, red wine in our hands, where does the wine flow white, like ethereal honey from the queen

we giggle, our teeth our stained -  a memory! - everything things to be bah now, everything isnt like that place that i rememorize, on the board of chalk beaten white boards and grey beards there are ships sailing out to see, in each a memory preserved, something whisping in a bottle

alas, i wonder, those dreams in bottle that wash up by the bay, were they only dropped treasures from a ship sailing to the vortex at the border of the worlds?
