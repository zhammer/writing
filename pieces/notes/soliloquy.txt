*The girl who had shaken her head and made all the jewels, the topaz, the aquamarine, the water-coloured jewels with sparks of fire in them, dance, now bared her brows and with wide-opened eyes drove a straight pathway over the waves...

-Virginia Woolf, The Waves*

***

it was silly in the wash. it was absolutely taking turns and going under. Soliloquy took her braids and washed them in the jewel like water, which, as she shook the water from her hair, rained down like jewels, and Persephony saw the jewels come from the hair, each with a different color from the sun, like the lights of the kabbalah.

when a purple jewel splashed into the water and became blue like the water Soliloquy had already dived into the next wave. Persephony watched her legs get engulfed in the waves, gracefully, like the neck of a bird, and come out clean on the other side of the wave. at this moment the purple jewel watched up on the shore in the form of a seashell, though to persephony, in the sun, the jewel was purple as it had been before when it flew from Soliloquyâ€™s hair.

and older woman with gray hair watched the girls. there was some bark on her wrist and she had been at the beach for a long time. and it was to persephony like there were two boys running on a sand bar on the water. and it was at this moment that a piece of bark was washed back into the sea. the sea, like it was pulling things from the beach into the water, pulled the purple jewel back into the water. and at this moment soliloquy raised her head out of another wave. and shook jewel-like colored drops of water from her hair.
