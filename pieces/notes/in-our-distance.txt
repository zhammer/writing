in our distance
i would prefer to let you drift into dxsence{{ footnote "'essence'" }}
a mirage of your memory mixed with the whirring sands and waves at the tip of my perception at the beach
mixed with mixing sun
which suns the beach and goldens each petal of that distant be

it is not because i hate you
 that i wish to cease comminication
 “this endless chatter”
that we bind ourselves to
to not let each other
drift
to the freedom
of our own
peripheries
a rare place where we can
exist
freely
in the unwrangleble frays
of the conscious
mixed woth sun
& sand

you liberate me when you forget me
