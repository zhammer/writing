were we to sit down and decide to talk
let's say
for three hours a week
i think that like two dancers
we would find
ourselves
drift apart
to opposit sides of the room
with one hand covering our eyes
and the other
reaching
with each finger feathered
out into span
towards each other
our eyes peaking through the fingers

then back closer together
we would
without touching each other
hold the same form
but now next to each other
so that our fingers shared the same space
still covering our eyes
perhaps peaking out more
circling each other

like two peregrine falcons
in the middle of tompkins park
people would watch us
in awe
at these two creatures
who
majestic
are not
where they are
supposed
to be
