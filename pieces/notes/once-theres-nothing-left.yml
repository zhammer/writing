          once there’s nothing left

          what will there be?

          when the giant sky

          that shifted colors

          like a chameleon

          and hid behind the cloud

          and showed it stars at night

          like the giant blanket for the dreaming baby

          out on the sea

          one at a time

          floating upwards

          until they’re gone

          and once they’re gone

          what waves

          will move across the sea

          and what will the tides

          do

          to the people walking on the —

          the top is blue like early day.
