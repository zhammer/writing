9/12

11:56am (goddard mountain)

wind blows mist
  downward
through the trees

6:54pm (kid gore shelter)

drifting to sleep-
  another passing rain

8:54pm

the wind rustles
  the highest leaves-
sound of rain

9/13

1:40am

rain has calmed
  i put down my book
and drift again to sleep

rain has calmed
  the pitter patter of raindrops
lulls me to sleep

eh.

the rain has calmed
  my eyes too sleepy
to read

8:34am

the cobwebs
  on the red leaves
untouched by the rain

12:30pm (near stratton road)

like a crumbling city
  a recent footstep
decomposes back into mud

cannonball!
  my left foot
splashes into a puddle

4:25pm (hiking down stratton)

sing to the woods
  afterwards
they show me their silence

9/14

12:20pm (after douglas)

a single leaf falls
  on the country road

9/16

8:08am (after bromley)

blue bird
  flies away
into the misty trees

10:44am (after pern??)

rock
  engulfed in the roots
of a fallen tree

3:54pm (by suspension bridge)

the wave in the current
  fights to go
back upstream

5:41pm (near lake shelter)

green & red
  the path forward covered with
moss & leaves

9/17

7:27am (pond)

like a diving sparrow
  a wet leaf
falls into the pond

9:50am (white ridge)

a tree
  with its slow & steady dtermination
seems to have split a rock

10am

blue jay
  jumps from branch to branch
in the mountain pines

did some yoga
  in the fallen pine needles
calm air

(white mountain overlook)

like little spirits
  rocks perched in treestumps
and branches

the pain in my left inner knee
  tugs gently
at my tear duct

like rimbaud's "tatters of silver"
  copper bark hangs wildly
to the mountain birch

11:36am (after road)

dragonfly wing?
  no-
piece of plastic

12:09pm (ascending bear mountain)

hiking up the mountain
  the snaps & crackles
of falling acorns

daddy longlegs
  must not know
its crossing the trail

another mushroom
  that looks like
overboiled crab

12:48pm

passing an empty creek
  i hear the sound
of water

1:30pm

like ghosts, or a memory
  i see two people i met yesterday
in the distance

an acorn falls hard
  in front of me-
luckily not on my head

2:04pm

the barkless tree
  has a long
belly button

of all the white wildflowers
  one batch
is lavendar-colored

9/18

7:28am

wet socks
  draped over a curved tree
like a mushroom growth
(memory from last night)

7:54am

early creep of autumn-
  even some ferns
are orange

9:03am

within an hour
  hiking uphill-
last night's fatigue

9:45am

the hours go on-
  as long as i'm moving,
so do the miles

10:46am (ascending killington)

like a stubborn dog
  that grumbles every moment its not pet-
my hungry stomach

look who's joined
  the party!
my right outer knee

4:55pm

holding my thumb out
  to hitch
whiff of my armpit

9/19

9:44am

in the sunny woods
  cool beadlets
of sweat

10:23am (after gap)

the leaf
  catches my eye
before its graceful descent

10:36am

acorn lands
  on the autumn leaves
and bounces

5:35pm

the creek
  under the bridge
chutes & ladders

6:33pm

sun on the next mountain
  comforts me
hiking at dusk

another temporary fall
  i catch myself
and walk forward

7:18pm

walking with my headlamp
  just me and
nocturnal moths

9/20

3:03pm

at the abandoned ski lift-
  a buzzing fly

5:26pm

tree fall down
  showing the vastness
of its roots

6:30pm

two trees fallen
  cradled in each other's arms
