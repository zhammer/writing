          everything was lining up, all the stars, right in front of me, and baby, it felt good, that big blue square before me which promised some sort of salvation from this thing that leaves its tethered roots around your arms, your neck, so you look ot the side and there is someone else in the quick sand, and babye, i knew, driving down tha troad, it was a deep and lonely desert, but i knew somethin then, i remember


          the last time i glanced at you, you were by a watermill, the water was pouring in sheaths onto your body and it was stroked with sunlight, a gazzling array, i ran towards you but the mist was in my eyes, and i became like pollen, you know, i was drifitng off into the wind


          when we lay down in the quick sand, our bodies piled up like on the railroad tracks, that jack o lantern of a horseless head riding towards us with deaths bitter tears dribbling down his mouth, i'll see you then, i promise you that


          take this clock, you can hold it in your hand so perhaps it is more something like an amulet, covered in ants, and in this village in mexico, you dig, there are women wearing green and red and purple dresses, the fabric looks something like the curtains in the dining room of my childhood home, when my dad would fight with me, you know, he'd crowd both lanes, so there was no way that i could get around him, like the bridge in williamsburg,some people take the lower level because it's quicker but i like to be out on top of everythign, you know, i was driving with my brother baby, best believe me, and he said "aren't magicians grand", but he was talking about bridges, and i said, looking at that bridge of cement and cars and people (not crashing andf falling into the sea) spread out across the river, the RFK bridge, you know, the tappanzee, now it has a mad mans name, mad as in angry, didja forget?


          i said that a bridge, ya dig, baby listen to me, i saw you with sheaths of water coming down on you, it was magical, it was marvelous and then you dissappeared, your hair was blonde or it was brunette or you were a man or a squid flaoting there in the droplets or even you were a turtle finding your way back home, but slwoly, and i didnt know where the river was, there was a windmill in a sandstorm and afterwards, after don quiixote and his talking jaw rode away, there were only burn marks and stains on the fabric of those towers


          fabrizzio was his name, i know that and you know it as well, when water splashes, when hail comes down with fire from the firey mouth of god, which neither you nor i believe in


          babe

          there is a ttrain coming

          you are laying beside me

          i see a last glimpse

          as if through the mist

          and then all i see

          is that blinding light


          i love you,

          sev


          p.s. don't get it twisted

          you'r the only one who ever meant nothin

          to me

          ma,


          sometimes you bury things and they're supposed to come out. but sometimes, a lot of people say this, squirrels bury nuts and forget half the nuts they bury. so there's nuts buried beneath these fields i walk on, i walk down washington squiare, madison square park, tompkins, where bob dylan and jeff buckley spoke, or some poor woman cried into her hands, a man shot up, someone died


          it's not your fault is what i mean to say. sometimes we bury things, we learn things, habits, some of them are good and some of them are bad


          this is all to say that perhaps it's time that i begin to lift of some of these things that's been buried. it's not your fault, adn i'll say that again, i did something bad too. i became i stuffer. so when things got hard i stuffed them away, it wasn't a problem it hoguht, it was one hard thing, i stuffed it somewhere, but overtime, as i went back, it became clluttered, moldy, and i had no where to put my things so i started stuffing them into places where they didnt fit, i've cleaneed every part of my apartment now except the closet, i open it  and a murky air comes out, there's t shirts and old candy bars in the same area, i know if i lift up one pair of pants a plume of dust will come out, but i also caant leave this place, you know, until i've sorted all of this out, so that for a few weeks i'll still be scared, you know


          it's not your fault is what i mean to say, that you began to bury, things were too hard, you were out on your own, so now you walk with your head down in the cold wind, you walk over rodes and you think that every plot of land has a burila, you tried to keep me in your arms above it all but i could feel those things in the subtle shifts of yourr bones, the reaction of your calfs when the breeze'd come in


          i just, you know, it's like a dog, people bury things, it happens all the time, if you're quiet you can sense it at a family dinner, especially that of another family, where you don't have to partake in this mad question, and then, sometimes, after spending a weekend with a new family, i have all these nightmares, these strange dreams, the estranged mother just wants the kids to enjoy her dinner, that she works so hard on in a shrivel in the kitchen, the father isn't there but the kids are up on the hill being mean to the mother,


          something gets lost is what i mean to say. i began stuffing things away and then it got the best of me, and then i became a mad old shriveled man in the closet, in the room,, pinned against the wall when things got bad, afraid to feel for fear that those feelings would bring something


          ma, i was walking with a woman once, she was beatiful, she had these acorn eyes, these curly bangs that ripped across her brow, she had a good laugh and looked scared, like an animal her pupils were big and i could imagine her just with her hands feeling her way around a party, listening to the arkestra, you know


          and she said that , you know , were she to ever let her hand speak, she makes puppets but she doesn't *use* them, because were it to speak then it'd just be all her fears


          the things we bury, you know, like sylvia plath, come back out into the air, it's impossible to not, it's because we bury too early, you buried too early, and now you're waiting for that faitful day to come, when you'll be buried with them, but ma, they're going to be hear with me, and all the things i've stuffed within me will erupt out and i'll be grasping for you in the darkness but you wont be there,


          we have 15 years ma, the yard isn't too big, i have a hefty shovel and all i need is a glass of lemonade


          i wantya to be light when yar resting, so i dont have to be so heavy and afraid whan i go to visit ya, and tell ya how i feel


          i really love, even despite everything, that's seemed to have gotten in the way

          always your better,

          pip
