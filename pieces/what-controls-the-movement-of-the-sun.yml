          what controls the movement of the sun?

          the panorama hanging above the baby’s crib?

          the hypotheses’ of ceo?

          the dusty book, “goodnight moon”, buried beneath games and garbage on a shelf?

          last night two planets collided.

          no supernova,

          no great change,

          no ripple through the cosmos.

          a great journalist sat outside

          on a cloudy night

          and set her intentions

          for the coming year.
