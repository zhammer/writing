          There was a large cow walking in the middle of moonshine roads, The big dipper up above and as he trotted along there were stars. A young girl whose name was redacted, but was Charcoal, had a large disk of rotating snow in her hands, Twas red. Rasperries. The moon was hanging low on a swing, swinging, sharing her dust with the world, and . Charcoal had the dust in her snow. :) There was dust to share, to spread, there were thr. Mongrols. And the shar. Dispir. And the dispirate sharing sweed and water would wed wat wat wat wat whed whed wat wonder. And Charcoa. Sarah. And she was in love ? But the r. Wonderous and was walking through the streets all sweet with dust. She was spreading her dust on floors . back at Home. Where she had imirgintly lost the sparkles where the dust had fallen on her rotated snow disk.


          Charcoal went home to mother. Mother was cold . But how she cooked the cherry soup that smelled so fragrant that it reminded Charcoal of Grandma and. When she walked home the cherry soup was warm and all mixed up and like a syrup. Charcoal sat in her bed. Kitchen table. Eating the syrupy sweetness. It was like sugar. Charcoal walked round and round her house. Smelling. Odors and cherries and old wood and oils and candlelight at night! How sweet. :) The odors were sweet as wine and Charcoal had never had a sip even but oh did she know when the cup's left out for Elijah.


          Judaism and Charcoal worked like a brother and a small little. Banana. Charcoal would wander through streets on fire in her heart with a sprinkling. Passion for joy. Charcoal and the red and the snow so soft like diamonds in the sky in winter that trickled dow. Tongue. And it was all melted too there in thair. Right thair in th. Air and it was cold but not too cold for a warm hand too warm up her chest or her cheek. Red. And her cheeks were soft on the snow, like petting a pupp. Dog. Puppy. Charcoal had a long goldfish. His head stuck ou. Toilet. Charcoal had a puppy too. His name was snake. Snake the goldfish retriever. Frisbee :). Frisbee sat low on the ground And. Charcoal picked him up and threw him in the air :). Across the d. Field. Driveways and the street across the home. The nex. Neighbor were friendly. Church :). The old place down the road. The old walk around the school. The old friends in the town. All the ho. Same. And nothing was too swet. Warned. Wondered. Charcoal spun her dust in the air like. Rollercoaster. And everyone knew that she was happy.

Frog a jumped. A jumped around. A jumped and lep. Tiger. (With his hands all in the water. All in the water and drinking :) He layed on his back. It was never wet on the dew. Just soft. Swet.)
